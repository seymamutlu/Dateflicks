2. Express is used for the external REST API for the clients.
3. Cote.js is used for the microservices.
3. MongoDB used for the DB 
4. You can start the application by "node server" command.
5. When you start the application; you will see the port 10110 is used for the REST API client
6. When you start you can see movieService, notificationService, playbackService, reviewService and userService starts automatically. You can start each in a separate terminal to see how they interach with each other.
